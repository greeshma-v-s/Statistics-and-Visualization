1.Consider a test to detect a disease that 0.1 % of the population have. The test is 99 % effective in detecting an infected person. However, the test gives a false positive result in 0.5 % of cases. If a person tests positive for the disease what is the probability that they actually have it?
Two production lines produce the same part.

2.Line 1 produces 1,000 parts per week of which 100 are defective. Line 2 produces 2,000 parts per week of which 150 are defective. If you choose a part randomly from the stock what is the probability it is defective? If it is defective what is the probability it was produced by line 1?
A store owner opens up a large shipment of shirts of various colours. It is found that the shipment has approximately 56% blue shirts. An employee of the store randomly selects five shirts to put on display. Find the probability that at least one of the selected shirts is blue.

3.Present the concept of Confidence Interval using any 3 examples (How do you estimate population parameter from a sample).
Present the concept of Hypothesis Testing and how to perform 1-tail and 2-tail t-test using it using examples.

4.Write functions for the following tasks:
Plot two numerical columns.
Plot one numerical and one categorical column.
Plot two numerical columns and one categorical column.
Check null values in a column.
Check the cardinality of a categorical column.
Use the above functions and perform necessary EDA on two datasets:
Titanic disaster dataset (link (Links to an external site.)).
American Express dataset (link (Links to an external site.)).
You must provide meaningful insights from EDA.
